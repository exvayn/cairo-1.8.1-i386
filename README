% ruby extconf.rb    # to check for dependencies and create Makefiles
% make               # to compile

# make install       # to install the cairo extension.
                     # The samples in the samples folder should be able
                     # to run before installation except text-on-path.rb
                     # and text2.rb. They uses Ruby/Pango with rcairo
                     # support. So you need to install rcairo and build
